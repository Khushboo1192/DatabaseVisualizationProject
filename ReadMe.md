Data on the HUES Platform is highly diverse and rapidly growing. Currently, this data is stored in separate platform modules using different data structures and file formats, making it difficult to explore holistically. This project involves the development of an open source database to enable the linked exploration of data on the platform in the form of visual representations for e.g. histogram graphs for energy demand, supply and technology data.
First part was the development of server based scripts to automatically extract relevant data from the modules of the existing HUES platform, and write this data to a common database. I have chosen MongoDB as the new database and everything can be retrieved in the form of JSON objects. Further, the users can also upload technology data files to the portal which will get stored in the new database MongoDB.
The development of a web-based portal for querying, visualizing and downloading data was the second part of the project development. As the database is migrated to MongoDB we can achieve fast data retrieval. Moreover, visual representations using graphical structures will help the researchers and practitioners for the development of models and analyses of distributed energy systems
